Analysis code for extracting density profiles from Rayleigh wave phase velocities which are measured using precision tilt sensors and a traditional seismometer. In addition to using seismic tilt signals in a new way, this is also a "single station" measurment meaning that the density profile would be measured for a single location. The traditional way of obtaining these profiles is to use an array of seismometers which effectively average over the spatial extent of the array.
